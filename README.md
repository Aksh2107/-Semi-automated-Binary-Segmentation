# Semi-automated-Binary-Segmentation
Here, I used the software Nuke to implement semi-automated binary segmentation.

Binary Image segmentation is the process of classifying the pixels of an image into two categories: pixels belonging to the foreground objects of an image and pixels belonging to the background objects of an image.
. In a probabilistic approach, label dependencies are modeled by Markov random fields (MRF) and an optimal
labeling is determined by Bayesian estimation, in particular maximum
a posteriori (MAP) estimation. The main advantage of MRF models
is that prior information can be imposed locally through clique potentials. The primary goal is to demonstrate the basic steps to construct
an easily applicable MRF segmentation model and further develop its
multiscale and hierarchical implementations as well as their combination in a multilayer model. MRF models usually yield a non-convex
energy function. The minimization of this function is crucial in order
to find the most likely segmentation according to the MRF model.
